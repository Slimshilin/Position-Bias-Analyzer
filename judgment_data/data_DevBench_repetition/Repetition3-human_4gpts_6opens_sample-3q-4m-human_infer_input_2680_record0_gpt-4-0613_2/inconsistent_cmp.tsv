    - `RedisCallback` facilitates the execution of custom operations within
      the Redis environment, allowing for tailored data handling and management strategies.

- **Generalized Serialization Interface (`Serializer`)**:
    - The `Serializer` interface provides a general framework for
      serialization, supporting a wide range of use cases and extending the project's versatility.

# Technical Constraints

1. The project must be written in Java, and it requires Java 11 as the Java version
2. Prior to running the project, a Redis instance should be running locally

# Requirements

## Dependencies

- Java11 Runtime Environment.
- a Redis instance is used for data storage.

## Usage

```shell
    nohup redis-server >/dev/null 2>&1 &
    ./gradlew test
    ./gradlew acceptanceTest
    ./gradlew shadowJar
    java -jar rediscache-1.0-all.jar input.txt output.txt
    redis-cli SHUTDOWN
```

The format of `input.txt` is lines of key-value paris of the cache. For example:

wGJpsRtX OIvXjhZp
GaUitCMw HufGRMdx
RTdTuMDg TXnGLQbe

The output file is the same as the input file, but with the values replaced by the values in the cache.

The number of lines of input and output file should be the same.

# Acceptance Criteria

- **Java Implementation**: All components of the Redis-cache project must be implemented in Java, adhering to standard
  Java coding practices and conventions.
- **Local Redis Instance**: The project should successfully connect to and interact with a locally running Redis
  instance for all data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Efficient Data Caching**: The Redis-cache component, particularly through RedisCache, must demonstrate a significant
  improvement in data retrieval speed compared to direct database queries.
  Serialization Accuracy: Data serialized and deserialized using JDKSerializer and KryoSerializer must maintain
  integrity, with no loss or corruption of data during the process.
- **Configurability and Customization**: The project must allow easy configuration and customization through RedisConfig
  and RedisConfigurationBuilder, with clear documentation on how to adjust settings for different environments.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: The caching solution should be scalable and maintain consistent performance under
  varying loads, as managed by components like DummyReadWriteLock.
- **Custom Operation Capability**: The RedisCallback and Serializer interfaces must allow for the execution of custom
  operations and serialization methods, enabling users to extend or modify the default behavior as per their application
  requirements.
- **Implementing build.gradle**: It's necessary to implement build.gradle to solve dependencies.

# Dependencies

This project requires a Java environment for code compilation and execution, specifically, Java version 11. The project
packaging should be completed using a Maven environment. A Redis instance is need for caching data storage.<PRD ends>.

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to create a UML sequence diagram that illustrates the dynamic behavior and interactions between classes and interfaces. Consider the following guidelines when developing your diagram:
1. Strive for a clear and integrated design that reflects a consistent style, with all components and interactions working smoothly together.
2. Balance the interaction complexity. Consider the number of messages, the depth of nested calls, and the number of participating objects. Ensure that the complexity is aligned with the PRD.
3. Focus on achieving high cohesion within sequences and low coupling between different system components. Each sequence should be focused and depict minimal dependencies.
4. Ensure your diagram is an accurate and comprehensive reflection of the system's behavior as specified in the PRD and the structural design outlined in the UML class diagrams.
5. Create a diagram that is easily interpretable for development, testing, and maintenance purposes. It should clearly represent the functionality of each class, document object creation instances, and demonstrate a modular and simple interface.
6. Write the markdown file to UML_sequence.md, following the specified format:
   # UML sequence
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       ......
   ```
7. Include functions not within a class as global functions. Functions in the sequence diagram do not need to detail parameters.
8. Provide a detailed and complete file, rather than a brief overview.
9. Seek a balance in the UML Sequence diagram between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability. If possible, encapsulate sequences within existing classes to reduce complexity."	"# UML sequence

# Technical Constraints

1. The project must be written in Java, and it requires Java 11 as the Java version
2. Prior to running the project, a Redis instance should be running locally

# Requirements

## Dependencies

- Java11 Runtime Environment.
- a Redis instance is used for data storage.

## Usage

```shell
    nohup redis-server >/dev/null 2>&1 &
    ./gradlew test
    ./gradlew acceptanceTest
    ./gradlew shadowJar
    java -jar rediscache-1.0-all.jar input.txt output.txt
    redis-cli SHUTDOWN
```

The format of `input.txt` is lines of key-value paris of the cache. For example:

wGJpsRtX OIvXjhZp
GaUitCMw HufGRMdx
RTdTuMDg TXnGLQbe

The output file is the same as the input file, but with the values replaced by the values in the cache.

The number of lines of input and output file should be the same.

# Acceptance Criteria

- **Java Implementation**: All components of the Redis-cache project must be implemented in Java, adhering to standard
  Java coding practices and conventions.
- **Local Redis Instance**: The project should successfully connect to and interact with a locally running Redis
  instance for all data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Efficient Data Caching**: The Redis-cache component, particularly through RedisCache, must demonstrate a significant
  improvement in data retrieval speed compared to direct database queries.
  Serialization Accuracy: Data serialized and deserialized using JDKSerializer and KryoSerializer must maintain
  integrity, with no loss or corruption of data during the process.
- **Configurability and Customization**: The project must allow easy configuration and customization through RedisConfig
  and RedisConfigurationBuilder, with clear documentation on how to adjust settings for different environments.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: The caching solution should be scalable and maintain consistent performance under
  varying loads, as managed by components like DummyReadWriteLock.
- **Custom Operation Capability**: The RedisCallback and Serializer interfaces must allow for the execution of custom
  operations and serialization methods, enabling users to extend or modify the default behavior as per their application
  requirements.
- **Implementing build.gradle**: It's necessary to implement build.gradle to solve dependencies.

# Dependencies

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to create a UML sequence diagram that illustrates the dynamic behavior and interactions between classes and interfaces. Consider the following guidelines when developing your diagram:
1. Strive for a clear and integrated design that reflects a consistent style, with all components and interactions working smoothly together.
2. Balance the interaction complexity. Consider the number of messages, the depth of nested calls, and the number of participating objects. Ensure that the complexity is aligned with the PRD.
3. Focus on achieving high cohesion within sequences and low coupling between different system components. Each sequence should be focused and depict minimal dependencies.
4. Ensure your diagram is an accurate and comprehensive reflection of the system's behavior as specified in the PRD and the structural design outlined in the UML class diagrams.
5. Create a diagram that is easily interpretable for development, testing, and maintenance purposes. It should clearly represent the functionality of each class, document object creation instances, and demonstrate a modular and simple interface.
6. Write the markdown file to UML_sequence.md, following the specified format:
   # UML sequence
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       ......
   ```
7. Include functions not within a class as global functions. Functions in the sequence diagram do not need to detail parameters.
8. Provide a detailed and complete file, rather than a brief overview.
9. Seek a balance in the UML Sequence diagram between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability. If possible, encapsulate sequences within existing classes to reduce complexity."	"# UML sequence

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to create a UML sequence diagram that illustrates the dynamic behavior and interactions between classes and interfaces. Consider the following guidelines when developing your diagram:
1. Strive for a clear and integrated design that reflects a consistent style, with all components and interactions working smoothly together.
2. Balance the interaction complexity. Consider the number of messages, the depth of nested calls, and the number of participating objects. Ensure that the complexity is aligned with the PRD.
3. Focus on achieving high cohesion within sequences and low coupling between different system components. Each sequence should be focused and depict minimal dependencies.
4. Ensure your diagram is an accurate and comprehensive reflection of the system's behavior as specified in the PRD and the structural design outlined in the UML class diagrams.
5. Create a diagram that is easily interpretable for development, testing, and maintenance purposes. It should clearly represent the functionality of each class, document object creation instances, and demonstrate a modular and simple interface.
6. Write the markdown file to UML_sequence.md, following the specified format:
   # UML sequence
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       ......
   ```
7. Include functions not within a class as global functions. Functions in the sequence diagram do not need to detail parameters.
8. Provide a detailed and complete file, rather than a brief overview.
9. Seek a balance in the UML Sequence diagram between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability. If possible, encapsulate sequences within existing classes to reduce complexity."	"# UML sequence

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a software tool designed to convert XLSX files to CSV. The tool aims to offer a simple, efficient, and precise conversion solution for users who need to transform spreadsheet data to a universally accessible format.

## Background

XLSX, while a popular format, isn't always accessible or compatible with every platform or tool. Many times, users need a more universal format such as CSV to facilitate data manipulation, sharing, or processing. This tool bridges that gap, allowing users to convert their XLSX data with ease.

## Goals

To provide a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use tool that accurately converts XLSX files to CSV format while retaining the integrity of the original data.

## Features and Functionalities:

1. **Command-Line Interface**: Users can invoke the software using the command pattern: `./xlsx2csv [xlsx filename] [output file path]`. This allows users to specify both the input file and decide the desired output file path.

2. **Multi-sheet Support**: Ability to process XLSX files with multiple sheets and output separate CSV files named after the sheets.

3. **Consistent Data Translation**: Ensures the output CSV files match the content of the respective XLSX sheets.

4. **Shared String Support**: Ability to process XLSX files with shared strings.

## Constraints

- The software is designed to support C++17. However, while it should be compatible with C++17, it can also be compiled using other versions of GCC.

## Use Cases

A user needs to convert XLSX files to CSV format. The reasons for this can vary, but the primary function is the conversion.

It can be used via command line:  `./xlsx2csv [xlsx filename] [output file path]`. Then the output csv file can be found in [output file path].

## Requirements

### Feature 1: **Command-Line Conversion**

- Users should be able to run the program via command line.
- Command pattern: `./xlsx2csv [xlsx filename] [output file path]`
- On successful conversion, the tool should display: ""Conversion successful. CSV files generated.""
- In case of incorrect command-line parameter use, the tool should display: ""Error: Please check the usage: ./xlsx2csv [xlsx filename] [output file path]"".
- In case of non existance input xlsx file, the tool should display: ""Error: Input File error.""

### Feature 2: **Multi-sheet Support**

- The software should detect and separately convert each sheet in an XLSX file.
- Each resulting CSV file should be named after its corresponding sheet name.

### Feature 3: **Data Integrity Assurance**

- The content of the CSV should exactly match that of the XLSX sheet.
- Ensure special characters, numbers, and text are accurately represented.
- Ensure it supports XLSX with shared strings.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Should convert an average-sized XLSX file in under a few seconds.
- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent conversions every time.
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and feedback to the user.

## Data Requirements

- **Data Sources**: User-provided XLSX files.
- **Data Security**: The tool processes data locally without internet access, ensuring data isn't exposed externally.
- **Data Privacy**: No collection or retention of user data.

## Design and User Interface

As this tool is command-line-based, the user interface is minimal. Feedback to users should be clear and concise, indicating success or specifying the nature of any errors.

The software project should have the following directory structure:

- **include**: This folder will hold all `.h` files.
- **source**: This folder will store all `.c/.cpp` files.
- The project root should also contain a `makefile` to facilitate the compilation of the software.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Converts an XLSX file to its equivalent CSV representations without loss of data.
- Processes multiple sheets from a single XLSX file into separate CSV files.
- Provides user feedback on the success or failure of conversions.

## Dependencies:

- Support C++17.
- The tool relies on ""tinyxml2"" for XML processing and ""miniz"" for zip operations.
- `.h` files from these libraries will be located in the `include` folder, and `.c/.cpp` files will be found in the `source` folder.

## Terms/Concepts Explanation

- **XLSX**: An XML-based spreadsheet file format used by Microsoft Excel.
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database.<PRD ends>.
UML_class: <UML_class starts>Then main function is not shown in this UML class. But make sure you have the file `main.cpp` and main function as the only entry point of the program.
The class `global_functions_and_types` is not a real class, but a collection of global functions and types.
The functions should be included in file `utils.h` and `utils.cpp`. The types should be included in file `types.h`.
You are encouraged to add more functions and types to the class `global_functions_and_types` if you need them. And you can add more classes if you need them. But do make sure you have the classes and functions in the UML class diagram.

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to create an architecture design for the project that reflects the following guidelines:
1. Ensure the architecture design demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components logically organized and integrated.
2. Focus on creating a practical and efficient architecture. This includes a logical file tree structure, clear class locations, and a modular design for ease of construction, testing, and maintenance.
3. Your design should accurately reflect the requirements and structural design outlined in the PRD and UML class diagrams, ensuring consistency in the development process.
4. Adhere to community and industry standards in your architecture design, particularly in file tree structure and coding practices. This includes following widely accepted conventions and best practices for the programming language used.
5. Write the markdown file to architecture_design.md, starting with:
   # Architecture Design
   Below is a text-based representation of the file tree.
   ```[file tree]```
   Use '├──', '│', '└──' to clearly depict the tree structure.
6. Include essential components such as '.gitignore', 'examples' (directory of usage examples), all class files, and 'outputs' (directory for output generation and storage). Omit 'docs' if not required.
7. Assign subsections for key elements like Outputs, Examples, and individual classes or code files. Include explanations for each, specifying formats for output files, purpose and results of examples, and the role of each method and their parameters in classes.
8. Provide a detailed and complete representation of the architecture, rather than a brief overview.
9. Balance accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your architecture design. Avoid unnecessary complexity while ensuring all necessary details are included."	"Below is a text-based representation of the file tree.

  - struct cell. `using cell = std::tuple<std::uint32_t, std::uint32_t, std::uint32_t>`. The first element is the row id, the second element is the column id, the third element is the shared string id. The shared string id is the index in workbook.shared_string. For example: Tuple(1, 1, 1), Tuple(3, 2, 10).
- utils.h: contains the definition of the utility functions.

- workbook.h: contains the definition of the Workbook class. Workbook class the main class of the software.
  - Workbook class is created by passing the path of the xlsx file to the constructor.
  - Workbook class is suggested to have a shared_ptr to the Archive class and a vector of unique_ptr of Worksheet class, but not necessary.
  - Workbook class should create archive object and worksheet objects in the constructor.
  - Workbook class has a vector of shared strings (in type vector<std::string>) to store the shared strings, acquiring from archive.get_shared_strings(). Note that the shared strings are started from index 1, rather than 0.
  - Workbook class has a vector of sheet relations (in type vector<sheet_desc>) to store sheet relations, acquiring from archive.get_sheet_relations().
  - Workbook class has a private function called get_sheet_cells(i) which returns a vector of cells (in type vector<cell>) of a sheet, and i is the sheet id. The sheet is specified by the sheet relation ID. The cells are acquired from archive.get_sheet_xml(), which returns a sheet xml (in type shared_ptr<tinyxml2::XMLDocument>).
  - Workbook class has a method called get_shared_string(i) which returns a shared string (in type std::string), and i is the index in shared_string.
  - Workbook class has a method called write_to_csv(output_path) which write to csv files.

- utils.cpp: contains the implementation of the utility functions.
- workbook.cpp: contains the implementation of the Workbook class.
- worksheet.cpp: contains the implementation of the Worksheet class.
- main.cpp: contains the entry point of the software. Should contain the main function `int main(int argc, char** argv)`. The main function should parse the command line arguments and call the function workbook.write_to_csv().

Makefile: contains the makefile of the software. The makefile should compile the source files into an executable file called ""xlsx2csv"". The makefile should also contain a target called ""clean"" which removes the executable file and all the object files. Here is the detailed usage:
``` makefile
make clean
make
./xlsx2csv input.xlsx output_dir
```
Note that we will check not only the output csv files, but also the build process. So please make sure that your makefile works well.

Your makefile should compile miniz.h, miniz.c, tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cpp into object files and also link properly.

Note that the folder ""include"" and ""source"" are given. And please do NOT change the file structure, otherwise you may get failed in the test.

Note that miniz.h, miniz.c, tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cpp are given. You can modify them as you want (though we do not encourage to do so). But please make sure that your makefile works well."	"# Architecture Design

- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent conversions every time.
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and feedback to the user.

## Data Requirements

- **Data Sources**: User-provided XLSX files.
- **Data Security**: The tool processes data locally without internet access, ensuring data isn't exposed externally.
- **Data Privacy**: No collection or retention of user data.

## Design and User Interface

As this tool is command-line-based, the user interface is minimal. Feedback to users should be clear and concise, indicating success or specifying the nature of any errors.

The software project should have the following directory structure:

- **include**: This folder will hold all `.h` files.
- **source**: This folder will store all `.c/.cpp` files.
- The project root should also contain a `makefile` to facilitate the compilation of the software.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Converts an XLSX file to its equivalent CSV representations without loss of data.
- Processes multiple sheets from a single XLSX file into separate CSV files.
- Provides user feedback on the success or failure of conversions.

## Dependencies:

- Support C++17.
- The tool relies on ""tinyxml2"" for XML processing and ""miniz"" for zip operations.
- `.h` files from these libraries will be located in the `include` folder, and `.c/.cpp` files will be found in the `source` folder.

## Terms/Concepts Explanation

- **XLSX**: An XML-based spreadsheet file format used by Microsoft Excel.
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database.<PRD ends>.
UML_class: <UML_class starts>Then main function is not shown in this UML class. But make sure you have the file `main.cpp` and main function as the only entry point of the program.
The class `global_functions_and_types` is not a real class, but a collection of global functions and types.
The functions should be included in file `utils.h` and `utils.cpp`. The types should be included in file `types.h`.
You are encouraged to add more functions and types to the class `global_functions_and_types` if you need them. And you can add more classes if you need them. But do make sure you have the classes and functions in the UML class diagram.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Delete records

./UMM delete person | school -id ID

## Update records

./UMM update person | school -id ID [options..]

-id is compulsory to update a person or school record.

Available options for person (at least one option to update a record):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Mentor

To assign a mentor for a student:

./UMM mentor assign -student STUDENT_ID -mentor FACULTY_ID

To look for the mentor of a given student:

./UMM mentor lookup -student STUDENT_ID

To look for students a given mentor mentors:

./UMM mentor lookup -mentor FACULTY_ID

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"Note that Global is not a real class but stands for global functions.

- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

# Usage

./UMM command target [options..]

## Add records

To add a new student, faculty or school, use the following command:
```
./UMM add person | school [options..]
```

Compulsory options for person:

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Compulsory options for school:

-name: string

## List records

To list all students, faculty or schools, use the following command:
```
./UMM search person | school 
```

Available options for person (at least one option to list records):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Delete records

./UMM delete person | school -id ID

## Update records

./UMM update person | school -id ID [options..]

-id is compulsory to update a person or school record.

Available options for person (at least one option to update a record):

-name: string
-age: integer
-school: integer, ID of the school
-type: 1 for student, 2 for faculty

Available options for school:

-name: string

## Mentor

To assign a mentor for a student:

./UMM mentor assign -student STUDENT_ID -mentor FACULTY_ID

To look for the mentor of a given student:

./UMM mentor lookup -student STUDENT_ID

To look for students a given mentor mentors:

./UMM mentor lookup -mentor FACULTY_ID

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"Note that Global is not a real class but stands for global functions.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction

The 'idcenter' project represents a sophisticated Java-based solution designed to address the critical need for
generating unique identifiers in various software applications. At its core, this project leverages three principal
components: IdWorker.java, SidWorker.java, and Base62.java, each playing a pivotal role in the identifier generation
process.

## Goals

The goals of the project are multi-fold:

To ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle an increasing number of ID generation requests seamlessly.
To guarantee reliability, ensuring each generated ID is unique and consistent.
To maintain efficiency, minimizing computational and storage overhead.
To provide flexibility and ease of integration into various existing systems.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

## Features and Functionalities

This project is an ID generator, providing efficient ID generation in a single-threaded environment and multi-threaded
concurrent ID generation functionality. It offers Base62 encoding functionality as a tool for users to use.

### IdWorker

- **Sequential ID Creation:** Generates IDs in a sequential manner, possibly using a combination of time-based and
  counter-based algorithms to ensure uniqueness and order.
- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments, preventing duplicate ID generation.

### SidWorker

- **Timestamp-Based IDs:** Potentially includes the functionality to generate IDs based on timestamps, useful for
  time-sensitive applications.
- **Format-Specific IDs:** Could offer ID generation in specific formats or patterns, catering to unique application
  needs.

### Base62

- **Base62 Encoding:** Transforms numeric IDs into a Base62 encoded string, reducing the length and enhancing
  readability.
- **Reversible Encoding:** Ensures that the encoded IDs can be reliably decoded back to their original form.

### Main

- **Application Entry Point:** Serves as the entry point for the main application.
- **Batch ID Generation and Storage:** The Main class accepts external parameters, utilizes different ID generation
  capabilities based on the parameters, generates a specified number of IDs, and then stores them in a designated file.

# Technical Constraints

- The application must be written in Java.

# Requirements

## Depencencies

- Java Runtime Environment.

## Usage

```bash
    ./gradlew jar
    java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt
    java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt
```

### Output format for idworker

Each line contains the ID and timestamp, separated by a comma, for example:

IdWorker1: 15099502923776, timestamp: 1705978534134
IdWorker2: 15099506257920, timestamp: 1705978534134

When you run  `java -jar idcenter.jar idworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 200 lines.

### Output format for sidworker

Each line contains the ID, for example:

SidWorker: 2024012310580246010

When you run `java -jar idcenter.jar sidworker 100 output.txt`, the output file `output.txt` should contain 100 lines.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. `IdWorker.java`

    - Generate a significant number of IDs (e.g., one million) and ensure there are no duplicates.
    - Verify that the generated IDs maintain an increasing sequence.
    - After a system restart, ID generation should resume while maintaining uniqueness and sequentiality.

2. `SidWorker.java`
    - Ensure each ID accurately reflects the timestamp of its generation, with no significant drift.
    - In cases of multiple IDs generated within the same millisecond, confirm that the sequence component of the ID
      maintains uniqueness.

3. `Base62.java`

    - Ensure that the encoding of the string matches the standard Base62 algorithm encoding results.
    - Decoding the encoded string should yield the original string.<PRD ends>.

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to create a UML sequence diagram that illustrates the dynamic behavior and interactions between classes and interfaces. Consider the following guidelines when developing your diagram:
1. Strive for a clear and integrated design that reflects a consistent style, with all components and interactions working smoothly together.
2. Balance the interaction complexity. Consider the number of messages, the depth of nested calls, and the number of participating objects. Ensure that the complexity is aligned with the PRD.
3. Focus on achieving high cohesion within sequences and low coupling between different system components. Each sequence should be focused and depict minimal dependencies.
4. Ensure your diagram is an accurate and comprehensive reflection of the system's behavior as specified in the PRD and the structural design outlined in the UML class diagrams.
5. Create a diagram that is easily interpretable for development, testing, and maintenance purposes. It should clearly represent the functionality of each class, document object creation instances, and demonstrate a modular and simple interface.
6. Write the markdown file to UML_sequence.md, following the specified format:
   # UML sequence
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       ......
   ```
7. Include functions not within a class as global functions. Functions in the sequence diagram do not need to detail parameters.
8. Provide a detailed and complete file, rather than a brief overview.
9. Seek a balance in the UML Sequence diagram between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability. If possible, encapsulate sequences within existing classes to reduce complexity."

The `Main` class is the entry point for the application and serves as the bridge between the different components.

The `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes generate IDs based on the current timestamp and a counter, and return the generated ID and timestamp to the `Main` class. The `Base62` class encodes and decodes IDs based on the standard Base62 algorithm. The `Main` class generates IDs based on the current timestamp and a counter, and returns the generated ID and timestamp to the `IdWorker` and `SidWorker` classes.

The sequence diagram illustrates the dynamic behavior and interactions between classes and interfaces in the 'idcenter' project.

```
In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object. The `delete` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and deletes it from the corresponding table in the database. The `update` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and updates the corresponding entry in the database.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"Here is a UML class mermaid diagram for the University Management System (UMM) based on the given PRD:

   class UMM {
       -db: SQLite

   UMM.add(school: School)
   UMM.add(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.search(person: Person)
   UMM.search(school: School)
   UMM.search(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.delete(person: Person)

   UMM.update(school: School)
   UMM.update(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.mentor(assign: Mentorship)
   UMM.mentor(lookup: Mentorship)
```
In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object. The `delete` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and deletes it from the corresponding table in the database. The `update` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and updates the corresponding entry in the database.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

Overall, this UML class diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the classes and their relationships in the University Management System. It accurately reflects the PRD's requirements and provides a solid foundation for effective coding, testing, and future maintenance."

PRD: <PRD starts># Introduction
The University Management System (UMM) is a C++ based information management tool that leverages SQLite for database management. The system is designed to facilitate the streamlined management of various entities within a university setting including students, faculty, and schools through a command-line interface. The project aims to centralize and simplify the process of managing different stakeholders in a university environment.

## Goals
The primary goal of the UMM project is to create a reliable and efficient management system that can handle the operations of a university seamlessly. It aims to facilitate easy addition, deletion, listing, and updating of details pertaining to students, faculty, and schools.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system using commands such as list, add, delete, and update followed by the entity (student, faculty, school) and respective options.
- **Database Design**: The database comprises three main tables: people, mentorship, and school, each designed to store specific details pertaining to the university's operations.
- **Database Creation and Connection**: The main.cpp file is responsible for creating the database (if it does not exist) and establishing a connection to it.

## Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: The project is built using C++ and integrates with SQLite for database management. Users must have the necessary environments to run C++ programs and SQLite databases.
- **User Knowledge**: Users should be familiar with command-line operations to effectively use the system.

## Use Cases
- **Adding a New Student**: An administrator can add a new student's details to the people table using the add command.
- **Listing All Faculty Members**: Users can list all faculty members using the list command followed by the faculty option.
- **Updating School Details**: Administrators can update the details of a school using the update command followed by the school option and respective details.

# Requirements
The UMM project requires a C++ environment for the execution of the main.cpp file and SQLite for database management. The database design is structured into three tables with specific fields to store details of people, mentorship relations, and schools.

## Feature 1
**Database Tables**
- **People Table**: Stores individual details including ID, name, age, and affiliated school.
- **Mentorship Table**: Records mentorship relations with fields for ID, student ID, and faculty ID.
- **School Table**: Holds information about different schools within the university, including ID and name.

## Feature 2
**Command-Line Operations**
- **add**: Allows users to add new entries to the database.
- **search**: Enables users to list all entries from a specific table.
- **delete**: Grants users the ability to delete entries from the database.
- **mentor**: Permits users to update existing entries in the database.
- **update**: Permits users to modify existing entries in the database.

# Data Requirements
The system uses SQLite for data storage, ensuring data security and privacy through the SQLite's inherent security features. Data sources include inputs from administrators through the command-line interface.

# Design and User Interface
The UMM operates through a command-line interface where users input commands to interact with the database. The interface should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback messages to facilitate smooth operations.

In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

# Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should meet the following criteria:
- **Correctness**: The system should execute commands accurately, reflecting the correct changes in the database.
- **Efficiency**: The system should handle database operations swiftly without delays.
- **Usability**: Users should find the system easy to use, with a straightforward command structure.

# Dependencies
- **C++ Environment**: Necessary for running the main.cpp file.
- **SQLite**: Required for database management and operations.

# [Optional] Terms/Concepts Explanation
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used for inputting commands directly to a computer program.<PRD ends>.
As the Senior Engineer, your task is to draw a UML class mermaid diagram showcasing classes, interfaces, and their static structures and relationships. While developing this diagram, consider the following guidelines:
1. Aim for a design that demonstrates a cohesive style and approach, with all components working harmoniously together.
2. Keep the design suitably complex, reflecting the PRD's requirements. Balance the number of classes and methods per class, and be mindful of inheritance depth.
3. Strive for clarity and focus within each class and aim for minimal dependencies between different classes.
4. Ensure your design accurately and fully reflects the PRD, capturing all necessary functionalities and relationships.
5. Create a design that is easy to read and understand, which will be helpful for programming, testing, and future maintenance. Consider the practical aspects of modularity and testing strategies.
6. Remember that a well-thought-out design is the foundation for effective coding. They are interconnected but distinct processes.
7. Write the markdown file to UML_class.md, adhering to the following format:
   # UML class
   `Global_functions` is a placeholder for global functions.
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
       ......
   ```
8. Treat functions not within a class as global functions, including them in a designated 'Global Functions' section. Detail functions with necessary parameters and data types, including output types if possible.
9. Provide a comprehensive and detailed representation, rather than a brief overview.
10. Seek a balance between accuracy, simplicity, readability, and implementability in your diagram. Consider encapsulating functions within existing classes to avoid unnecessary complexity."	"Here is a UML class mermaid diagram for the University Management System (UMM) based on the given PRD:
```mermaid

   class Person {
       -id: int
       -name: string
       -age: int
       -school: int
       -type: int
   }

   class School {
       -id: int
       -name: string
   }

   class Mentorship {
       -id: int
       -student: int
       -faculty: int
   }

   class UMM {
       -db: SQLite
       -people: Person[]
       -schools: School[]
       -mentorships: Mentorship[]
   }

   UMM --|> Person
   UMM --|> School
   UMM --|> Mentorship

   Person --|> UMM
   School --|> UMM
   Mentorship --|> UMM

   UMM.add(person: Person)
   UMM.add(school: School)
   UMM.add(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.search(person: Person)
   UMM.search(school: School)
   UMM.search(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.delete(person: Person)
   UMM.delete(school: School)
   UMM.delete(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.update(person: Person)
   UMM.update(school: School)
   UMM.update(mentorship: Mentorship)

   UMM.mentor(assign: Mentorship)
   UMM.mentor(lookup: Mentorship)
```
In this diagram, we have three main classes: `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship`. Each class represents a table in the database, with fields that correspond to the columns in the table.

The `UMM` class is the main class that interacts with the database and provides the command-line interface for users to interact with the system. It has three fields: `db`, `people`, and `schools`, which are arrays of `Person` and `School` objects, respectively. It also has three methods: `add`, `search`, `delete`, `update`, `mentor`, and `lookup`.

The `add` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and adds it to the corresponding table in the database. The `search` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and returns all the entries in the corresponding table that match the given object. The `delete` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and deletes it from the corresponding table in the database. The `update` method takes a `Person` or `School` object as an argument and updates the corresponding entry in the database.

The `mentor` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and assigns a mentor to a student. The `lookup` method takes a `Mentorship` object as an argument and returns the mentor of a given student.

The `Person`, `School`, and `Mentorship` classes are related to the `UMM` class through inheritance. The `Person` and `School` classes are subclasses of the `UMM` class, while the `Mentorship` class is a subclass of the `Person` class. This allows us to access the `UMM` class's methods and fields from the `Person` and `School` classes, while also allowing us to access the `Person` class's methods and fields from the `Mentorship` class.

Overall, this UML class diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the classes and their relationships in the University Management System. It accurately reflects the PRD's requirements and provides a solid foundation for effective coding, testing, and future maintenance."

```"	"codellama-13b-instruct"	"human"	""	"- Cohesion and Decoupling: The design should aim for high cohesion within individual classes and low coupling between different classes. High cohesion ensures that each class is dedicated to a singular task or concept, enhancing clarity and functionality. Low coupling reduces dependencies among classes, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- Complexity: Utilize metrics such as the total number of classes, the average number of methods per class, and the depth of the inheritance tree to evaluate complexity. It's important to discern between conceptual classes and attributes; not every noun should become a class. The complexity level should be appropriately balanced, aligning with the specific requirements detailed in the project's Product Requirement Document (PRD).
- Practicability: A practical design should be readable and understandable, offering a clear and comprehensive representation of the software's structures, functionalities, and behaviors. This enhances ease in programming, testing, and maintenance. Modularity should be evident, with each component serving a distinct function, streamlining the development process. Interfaces need to be designed for simplicity, facilitating smooth interactions within the software and with external environments. The design must also support robust testing strategies, enabling thorough validation through unit and acceptance tests, ensuring the design's viability in real-world applications."
